    <div>
        !!!add collapsing thing for this!!!
        herein lies a bit of a rambling explanation of some personal takes; kinda silly to have but it's here I guess
    </div>
    <div>
        I try to do the best I can to learn what is learnable, and learn about the difficulties in learning things that are at the moment insurmountable. What the latter means is that I cannot quite approach learning about the Sentinelese language, considering that research is not possible there due to the priorities of Sentinelese people: it is important to respect that and it is not a situation under my control.
        Learning is my greatest passion, and that means that I must understand things incorrectly or with less nuance than is optimal, until I can learn about something more deeply.
        It is unreasonable to expect that someone new to a field learn everything with perfect nuance, after all.
        I value the notion that people can change their minds. People grow and change, personality is as mutable as perspective.
        The idea that what I put on this website or post about on Twitter or what have you is a perennial view or opinion...that, to me, is ludicrous. We've all made claims we no longer stand by, and if we find out that someone has indeed changed their stance, there's not much reason to attack them for having had a bad/wrong opinion before. There is perhaps reason to attack them for having had a lasting negative impact by promoting or doing something, because some things are impossible to live down because of their significance; that doesn't mean that the person in question hasn't changed their mind of their own accord, through a discussion, or through retrospect provided by any force, really. Examples can be somewhat extreme, so I don't know that I want to go in depth, but just believing that people <em>can</em> change? I think that's valuable.
        And hey, I might change my mind on this opinion.
        I prefer to promote actual discussion about things I find worth discussing: if something can be looked up, there is no need to argument over it! 
    </div> -->
    <h2>Research interests</h2>
    <!-- Put some kind of nice display for the interests with maybe like colored blocks for the broad subfield names and corresponding descriptions of particulars. Maybe some kind of explanations about where intersections occur between the fields-->
    <div>
        So it's interesting to think about "research interests," because the way I think about it is kind of funky? So there are methodologies I like (and frameworks for acquiring and using data from those, which is...methodology also). There's also features I'm interested in. There's also categories of typological intrigue I'm interested in. All of these end up being called "subfields" or whatever, but it's hard for me to justify that kind of framing. I guess you could say I'm interested in morphology and semantics and historical linguistics, but historical linguistics can deal specifically with morphological and semantic features, no? I haven't figured out how to word it yet.
    <h3 id="method">
        Methods
    </h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        I consider my chief interest in methodology to be at an intersection between language documentation, sociolinguistics, and computational linguistics. More specifically, though:
    </div>
    <div id="doc">
        In language documentation, I find contact linguistics to be a fascinating and important aspect of the world we live in. It's odd that we often tend to waffle between "language isn't branching, we need to keep in mind that contact is always a thing" and "we should call this a nonce borrowing, because it hasn't been rephonologized." I don't think they're exclusive statements, and I don't think we need to be wrestling between a million dimensions of careful wording when a charitable reading is easily made. That said, my interest in documentation wants to work with that interesting relationship. It's a convoluted path to discuss, but reconstructing grammatical patterns and pathways can be especially interesting when we consider contact and areal features. Synchronically, this necessitates some level of attention to sociolinguistics.
    </div>
    <div id="socio">
        As for sociolinguistics, I am fascinated by linguistic variation, the methods developed for the analysis of variation are many but there is room to improve. The reason I consider my methodological interest to be at the intersection of documentation and sociolinguistics is because I find that the documentation of sociolinguistics, including of course variation, is severely lacking. There are many active efforts to improve this state of affairs, and I am excited to be a member of that movement.
    </div>
    <div id="comp">
        My interest in computational linguistics is less about machine learning and more about the processes in linguistics that can be aided by use of computational methods. Almost all pipelines in linguistics involve some kind of computational methods, of course, so where do I fit? I go where I'm needed at a high level. That is, I want to work with others to build software that is easy to interface with as linguists with little experience in building computational tools. The semantic satiation of "computational" is hitting me hard right now, wow. Just as I see a poor state of affairs in sociolinguistic variation in documentation, I see an unnecessary loyalty to software that doesn't necessarily best suit us as fieldworkers and people working with data from the field. That said just as I see a pattern of improvement in documentation of sociolinguistic variation, I see more and more efforts to improve our options for tools in the field<span style="color: white;">, especially finding a way to remove FLEx from the picture</span>
    </div>
    <div id="features">Features I find especially interesting these days involve TAM(EV), the labrynthine pathways of phonologization and grammaticalization (and how they come together in amazing ways!). I really like language though, is the thing. Like, dang! Language! Rules! Even if I don't nevessarily buy into all aspects of a framework doesn't mean I don't think it isn't cool. We can have some lovely hypothesis generation from just some tranquil OT tableaux. Language is fun and I'm here to have a good time.</div>
