            <div>Alternative for surname's first two syllables: ɐˈnɐ or ˈɑnɐ. Check out the recording below to hear me say it: first for the normal pronunciation, then adapted for my variety of English feel free to rephonologize if you need to, but I'd love if you actually tried! If you feel weird because you think you're putting on an Indian accent...it's because you are and that's how it's pronounced! Not a bad thing! That's the point! :)</div>

    <h3>Also you can call me Sunny if you'd like, most people do!</h3>

    <p>My first name means "resolution" (like a New Year's Resolution, not like that of a photo), and would actually be written as <em>sankalp</em> when using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAST" target="_blank">IAST</a>. Because of my surname, some people think that my first name is from Malayalam <em>sankalpam</em>, meaning "dream, imagination". Malayalam has a large portion of vocabulary derived from Sanskrit despite being a Dravidian language, and this is one such word, but the meaning has shifted, and in my case, the name is simply directly from Sanskrit. None of this becomes easier to grok when you find out my dad's family is from Palakkat, which is in Kerala (where Malayalam is most spoken).

    <p>Contrary to this site's URL, my last name is Ananthanarayan, not Ananth. Some in my family shorten it to just that. I prefer using the full last name, and of course use it on publications.</p>

    <h4>Pronouns</h2>
    <div id="pronouns">English: any pronouns (they/them, he/him, she/her). Español: elle/le/-e o, si es más fácil, él/lo/-o. Português: ele/o/-o. You can read more about pronouns <a href="https://medium.com/trans-talk/faq-on-pronouns-trans-people-b501cb1f668f">here</a>.</div>
    <div id="gender" style="color:white">Gender happens in other ways in other languages, which is why I give "-e" and "-o" above--those are endings in Spanish and Portuguese used for gender agreement. In Indian languages, I tend to use agreement with masculine genders, because of convenience (and what my gender needs to be when in India).</div>

    <h2>Hi there!</h2>
    <div class="intro">
        I'm currently a post-baccalaureate researcher at Yale University, on projects about technology oriented toward language work (viz. language documentation and reclamation) as well as semantics and historical linguistics, particularly focussed on negation and mood in Australian languages at the moment. I am passionate about archiving and my current work also involves augmenting aspects of the <a href="http://www.pamanyungan.net/chirila/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chirila database</a>. See my <a href="./interests.html">interests page</a> to get a better idea of what I'm interested in broadly and what I have done in the past, beyond just my current work.
    </div>
    <div id="land-ack">
        I am currently based out of New Haven, Connecticut, on the unceded territory of the Mohegan, Mashantucket Pequot, Eastern Pequot, Schaghticoke, Golden Hill Paugussett, Niantic, and Quinnipiac peoples. I honor and respect the enduring relationship that exists between these peoples and nations and this land
