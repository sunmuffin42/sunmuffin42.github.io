    <!-- <h2>Personal approaches to interests</h2>
    <div>
        !!!add collapsing thing for this!!!
        herein lies a bit of a rambling explanation of some personal takes; kinda silly to have but it's here I guess
    </div>
    <div>
        I try to do the best I can to learn what is learnable, and learn about the difficulties in learning things that are at the moment insurmountable. What the latter means is that I cannot quite approach learning about the Sentinelese language, considering that research is not possible there due to the priorities of Sentinelese people: it is important to respect that and it is not a situation under my control.
        Learning is my greatest passion, and that means that I must understand things incorrectly or with less nuance than is optimal, until I can learn about something more deeply.
        It is unreasonable to expect that someone new to a field learn everything with perfect nuance, after all.
        I value the notion that people can change their minds. People grow and change, personality is as mutable as perspective.
        The idea that what I put on this website or post about on Twitter or what have you is a perennial view or opinion...that, to me, is ludicrous. We've all made claims we no longer stand by, and if we find out that someone has indeed changed their stance, there's not much reason to attack them for having had a bad/wrong opinion before. There is perhaps reason to attack them for having had a lasting negative impact by promoting or doing something, because some things are impossible to live down because of their significance; that doesn't mean that the person in question hasn't changed their mind of their own accord, through a discussion, or through retrospect provided by any force, really. Examples can be somewhat extreme, so I don't know that I want to go in depth, but just believing that people <em>can</em> change? I think that's valuable.
        And hey, I might change my mind on this opinion.
        I prefer to promote actual discussion about things I find worth discussing: if something can be looked up, there is no need to argument over it!

    <h2>Research interests</h2>
    <!-- Put some kind of nice display for the interests with maybe like colored blocks for the broad subfield names and corresponding descriptions of particulars. Maybe some kind of explanations about where intersections occur between the fields-->
    <div>
        I consider my chief interest to be at an intersection between language documentation, sociolinguistics, and computational linguistics. More specifically, though:
        
    </div>
    <div id="doc">
        In language documentation, I find contact linguistics to be a fascinating and important aspect of the world we live in.
    </div>
    <div id="socio">
        As for sociolinguistics
    </div>
    <div id="comp">
        My interest in computational linguistics is less about machine learning and more about the processes in linguistics that can be aided by use of computational methods. Almost all pipelines in linguistics involve some kind of computational methods, of course, so where do I fit? Truly
