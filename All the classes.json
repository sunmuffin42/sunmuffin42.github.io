Within our class' scope were topics such as phonetics, phonology, syntax, audism, oralism, historical contexts, and historical linguistics."

Because it was a small class, we spent much of our time discussing amongst ourselves how useful formalisms are in making claims about change, and came to the conclusion that there should be much more motivation for using a framework than that it makes a pleasant mathematical formula.
