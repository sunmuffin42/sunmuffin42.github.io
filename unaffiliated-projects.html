    <h1>Projects without affiliation to any institutions</h1>
    <div class="intro">
        While I have worked at and for various institutions at various points in my career, I also have some projects that have no affiliation to universities or funded research groups. While they're at varying levels of deprecation, I'm quite proud of the work I've done to make them happen to whatever extent they did!

        Back in high school, when I was just getting into linguistics, I was really interested in historical linguistics because it was so approachable without having to take a bunch of classes. Since I had a fairly large following through Tumblr, I crowdsourced various inquiries of interest. One of these was a response to (1) my frustration with the limitations of the Swadesh list and (2) thoughts on language pedagogy and how we could better benefit from different or improved methods.
        I did not aim to solve any problems, but I just hoped to build a resource. This resource came in the form of a Google spreadsheet which I dubbed, rather uncreatively, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rtrloJXhePBtrR1niX7GDpNzWgg6rN9kErXOf7IKPVg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Themed Terms</a>
        There are 42 natural languages and 6 conlangs represented, with varying levels of thoroughness. The idea here was to collect words in particular conceptual domains, such as Water or Flora. While there are many flaws with it, I'm impressed at how much has been done and it seems like people still edit it every so often?! I'd love for you to contribute if you have any desire to. There's a special sheet toward the end with music recommendations so I'd love some of those too!
