    <title>Fun things</title>

    <span>Much to the others' chagrin, I really love two of the world's most despised genres: improv and ska. Different things they're genres of, obviously. But improv is so fun? And I love ska, it's so fun. Why do people hate it! The beauty of improv, for me, is that as a player, you actually get to learn how to interact with people and receive immediate feedback; what's special about improv specifically with regard to that is that after bombing, you get another chance. Immediately. Of course some people will lose interest, but it's beautiful that you get forgiven so quickly because it's on to the next one. I like ska because it's exciting, it's very welcoming to dancing to (oof what a weirdly worded phrase). Lyrics are nearly never about romantic love, often even not about sexual love. Love of friends and partying, lots of passion for political messaging.</span>

        I do stuff though yeah. I like to swing dance (east coast mostly because my experiences with west coast hadn't been great but I'm open to trying to out in a new setting! Also lindy is S C A R Y I don't have that dexterity yet (Yet!!))
        I also have been getting into TTRPG things, but as far as I remember I've only played 5e DnD. It scratches that itch for improv.
