    <h1 class="resource">All my bookmarks</h1>
    <div id="bookmarks">
        I collect resources. I have a lot of them and I love sharing them. One of my prouder resource collections is that of bookmarks on my browser. You can see them <a href="./bookmarks_10_25_22.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on this page</a> (last updated 2022/10/25). You'll find linguistics, language, programming, TTRPG, media, art, cool stuff, recipes, medicine, and school resources.

    <h1 class="resource" id="wiki-header">Wikipedia editing</h1>
    <div id="wiki">
        I will put some resources for Wikipedia editing here. The upshot is, <em>do it!</em> Don't keep waiting until you learn how to do things the best way. If there's a typo or unclear wording, fix it! That's the whole point of "wiki" things: everyone helping when they can. If you're going to add actual content, make sure you can cite a source to say so, though. And if you want to do that, there are simple buttons to insert references. It's intimidating, but oh-so-satisfying when you get it into it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Getting_started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get started!</a>
